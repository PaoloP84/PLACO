# PLACO

This is the official repository of the PLACO (PLAstic COnsumables) datasets, namely PLACO-2 and PLACO-4. The two datasets contain the same images, but
differ with respect to the image labeling. In particular, images in PLACO-2 are labeled according to two classes, while PLACO-4 differentiates images
based on four categories. The PLACO repository contains two folders, PLACO-2 and PLACO-4, which are internally organized into six sub-folders:

1) training;
2) validation;
3) test_set_1;
4) test_set_2;
5) test_set_3;
6) test_set_4.

The datasets have been used to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The repo includes also the CSV files containing the association between images and labels. 

The images contained in this repo can be used only for scientific/academic purposes. Any commercial or unauthorized use requires prior written permission
from MACS s.r.l. (website: https://www.macs-srl.it/), which retains all the rights of the PLACO-2 and PLACO-4 datasets.
