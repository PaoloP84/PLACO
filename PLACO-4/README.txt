# LABELING

The labeling of images contained in the PLACO-4 dataset is based on four classes:

0: "Empty Large" -> empty consumable (size = large);
1: "Empty Small" ->  empty consumable (size = small);
2: "Full Large" -> consumable containing the anticoagulant (size = large);
3: "Full Small" -> consumable containing the anticoagulant (size = small).
